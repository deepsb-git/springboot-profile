# springboot-profile

```
Using Spring Boot profiles is a powerful way to manage environment-specific configurations for different stages of your application lifecycle—like development (dev), testing (test), user acceptance testing (uat), and production (prod). Here's a comprehensive strategy to implement and manage these profiles effectively:

dev – for local development
test – for automated testing
uat – for user acceptance testing
prod – for production deployment

```
